# Instructions

I promise not to forget that all future assignments may be heavily 
penalized for failure to commit frequently as I do my work.

Academic Career: My academic career had been on a steady pace. I just transfered from fullerton collge to CSUF 
and im slowly adjusting to the new campus. I've been thinking about changing my major from Computer Science to 
Cybersecurity since the paths are interchangable. I'll see how this semster goes and i'll reconsider if needed. 

Favorite Food: I'd say my favorite food is sushi. I didn't really like it when I was younger but as I got 
older I tried suhsi again and I fell in love. Now I can eat any kind of sushi rolls. My favorite kind are
the rolls that have raw fish, anything raw fish is delicious. no rice rolls are also really realy good. I'm 
feening just thinking about sushi right now tbh

Favorite Video Game: I'm a chronic league of legends player. I have a severe addiction when it comes to that
game. I rage but I can't get enough of it. Whenever I win I get a sense of being better than my opponents. 
I've tried games like Overwatch 2 and Marval Rivals but neither of those give me a sense of satisfaction like 
League
