I promise not to forget that all future assignments may be heavily 
penalized for failure to commit frequently as I do my work.

Academic Career: My academic career had been on a steady pace. I just transfered from fullerton collge to CSUF 
and im slowly adjusting to the new campus. I've been thinking about changing my major from Computer Science to 
Cybersecurity since the paths are interchangable. I'll see how this semster goes and i'll reconsider if needed. 

Favorite Food: I'd say my favorite food is sushi. I didn't really like it when I was younger but as I got 
older I tried suhsi again and I fell in love. Now I can eat any kind of sushi rolls. My favorite kind are
the rolls that have raw fish, anything raw fish is delicious. no rice rolls are also really realy good. I'm 
feening just thinking about sushi right now tbh

Favorite Video Game: I'm a chronic league of legends player. I have a severe addiction when it comes to that
game. I rage but I can't get enough of it. Whenever I win I get a sense of being better than my opponents. 
I've tried games like Overwatch 2 and Marval Rivals but neither of those give me a sense of satisfaction like 
League 

Favorite Artist: I have two currently that are my top favorite music artist. Number one would be AURORA. I first
started listening to her music when I was in my freshman year of Highschool. I had to pick a contemporary
song for my dance piece and her song Runaway was the one that caught my attention. Second place would be 
Doja Cat. I love her as a person and her music. She recently released a song called Jealous Type. If this is
being read, you should definitely give it a listen.
